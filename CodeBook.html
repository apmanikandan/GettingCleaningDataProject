<p><strong>Raw data collection</strong></p>

<p><strong>Collection</strong> </p>

<p>The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. </p>

<p>The obtained data set has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.</p>

<p><strong>Signals</strong>
 The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain</p>

<p>The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:</p>

<p>. mean(): Mean value</p>

<p>. std(): Standard deviation</p>

<p>. mad(): Median absolute deviation</p>

<p>. max(): Largest value in array</p>

<p>. min(): Smallest value in array</p>

<p>. sma(): Signal magnitude area</p>

<p>. energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values.</p>

<p>. iqr(): Interquartile range</p>

<p>. entropy(): Signal entropy</p>

<p>. arCoeff(): Autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4</p>

<p>. correlation(): Correlation coefficient between two signals</p>

<p>. maxInds(): Index of the frequency component with largest magnitude</p>

<p>. meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency</p>

<p>. skewness(): Skewness of the frequency domain signal</p>

<p>. kurtosis(): Kurtosis of the frequency domain signal</p>

<p>. bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.</p>

<p>. angle(): Angle between some vectors.</p>

<p><strong>Data transformation</strong>
The raw data sets are processed with run_analisys.R script to create a tidy data set</p>

<p><strong>Merge training and test sets</strong></p>

<p>Test and training data (X_train.txt, X_test.txt), subject ids (subject_train.txt, subject_test.txt) and activity ids (y_train.txt, y_test.txt) are merged to obtain a single data set. Variables were labelled with the names assigned by original collectors (features.txt).</p>

<p><strong>Extract mean and standard deviation variables</strong></p>

<p>From the merged data set is extracted and intermediate data set with only the values of estimated mean (variables with labels that contain &ldquo;mean&rdquo;) and standard deviation (variables with labels that contain &ldquo;std&rdquo;).</p>

<p><strong>Use descriptive activity names</strong></p>

<p>A new column is added to intermediate data set with the activity description. Activity id column is used to look up descriptions in activity_labels.txt.
Label variables appropriately</p>

<p><strong>Create a tidy data set</strong></p>

<p>From the intermediate data set is created a final tidy data set where numeric variables are averaged for each activity and each subject.</p>

<p>The tidy data set contains 10299 observations with 81 variables divided in:</p>

<p>an activity label (Activity): WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
an identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment (Subject): 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30
a 79-feature vector with time and frequency domain signal variables (numeric)</p>
